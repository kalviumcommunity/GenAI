**Concept**

Function Calling allows the AI to call external functions or APIs when needed.
Instead of just generating text, the AI can return a structured JSON output that triggers a real action (e.g., fetch weather, solve a math problem, query a database).

Why Function Calling Helps StudyBuddy AI

 Interactivity – Students can directly ask for live calculations, definitions, or facts.

 Dynamic Learning – AI connects to dictionaries, math solvers, or even external APIs.

 Structured Output – Reliable JSON means results are consistent and can power features in apps.

 Hands-on Practice – Students don’t just read; they can test concepts live.

 **Example 1 – Calculator Function**

Prompt:

What is 25 * 16? Use the calculator function if needed.


AI Response (with Function Call):

{
  "name": "calculator",
  "arguments": {
    "operation": "multiply",
    "a": 25,
    "b": 16
  }
}


Function Output:

{"result": 400}


Final Answer (AI):

25 × 16 = 400

**Example 2 – Dictionary Lookup**

Prompt:

What does the word 'photosynthesis' mean? Use dictionary lookup.


AI Response (with Function Call):

{
  "name": "dictionary_lookup",
  "arguments": {
    "word": "photosynthesis"
  }
}


Function Output:

{"definition": "The process by which green plants use sunlight to synthesize food from carbon dioxide and water."}


Final Answer (AI):

Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants use sunlight to make food from carbon dioxide.
