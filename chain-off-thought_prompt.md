**Chain-of-Thought Prompting**

Concept

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting makes the AI explain its reasoning step by step before giving the final answer.
This is very useful for maths, logic, and subject explanations because students don’t just get the answer — they learn the process.

**Why Chain-of-Thought Helps Study Buddy AI**

 Encourages conceptual learning instead of rote answers.

 Builds trust by showing how an answer was reached.

 Matches exam-style answers where stepwise reasoning is rewarded.

 Makes students practice structured thinking.

 Example 1 – Math Problem

Prompt:

Solve this: A train travels 120 km in 2 hours. What is its average speed? Show step-by-step reasoning.

AI Response (Chain-of-Thought):

1. Distance traveled = 120 km
2. Time taken = 2 hours
3. Average speed = Distance ÷ Time = 120 ÷ 2
4. Final Answer = 60 km/h

Example 2 – History Question

Prompt:

Explain why World War I started. Show reasoning step by step.


AI Response (Chain-of-Thought):

1. Militarism in Europe created an arms race.  
2. Alliances divided Europe into two rival blocs.  
3. Imperialism created conflicts over colonies.  
4. Nationalism increased tensions in the Balkans.  
5. Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand acted as a trigger.  
Final Answer: These factors combined led to the outbreak of World War I in 1914.

Example 3 

Prompt:

Why does ice float on water? Show reasoning step by step.


AI Response (Chain-of-Thought):

1. Most substances become denser when they solidify.  
2. Water is different: when it freezes, its molecules form a crystalline structure.  
3. This structure has more empty space, making ice less dense than liquid water.  
4. Objects that are less dense than water float.  
Final Answer: Ice floats because it is less dense than liquid water.
