Multi-Shot Prompting

Multi-shot prompting is when we give the AI **multiple examples (2–5)** before asking it to perform a task.  
- **Zero-shot** → no examples.  
- **One-shot** → one example.  
- **Multi-shot** → several examples.  

This improves **accuracy, consistency, and structure** in the AI’s response.  

**Example Prompt**

You are Study Buddy AI. Summarize any given topic into clear, simple points for a student.
Here are examples:

Example 1:
Input: "Explain Photosynthesis"
Output:

Plants use sunlight to make food.

Chlorophyll absorbs light.

Water + carbon dioxide → glucose + oxygen.

Happens in the chloroplast.

Example 2:
Input: "Explain Newton's 3rd Law"
Output:

For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

Example: Rocket pushes gas backward → rocket moves forward.

Balances forces in nature.

Example 3:
Input: "Explain Pythagoras Theorem"
Output:

In a right triangle: a² + b² = c².

'c' is the hypotenuse (longest side).

Used in geometry, trigonometry, architecture.

**Now summarize: "Blockchain in simple terms"**


##  Expected Output  

Blockchain is a digital ledger (like a notebook).

Records transactions in blocks, linked in order.

Hard to change → very secure.

Used in Bitcoin, supply chains, banking.
