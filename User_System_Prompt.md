**Concept**

In Generative AI, prompts can be divided into two types:

System Prompt → Defines the AI’s role, behavior, and style of response. It acts as the foundation instruction.

User Prompt → The actual query or request given by the user. It is what the AI responds to, while still following the system prompt rules.

This separation ensures consistent, reliable outputs while allowing flexibility for user queries.


How It Helps StudyBuddy AI

Consistency → No matter what subject the user asks about, StudyBuddy AI will always explain in a student-friendly tone.

Personalization → User prompts can be subject-specific (Math, Science, History), while the system prompt keeps the explanation simple and supportive.

Scalability → The same system prompt can serve thousands of students, and each one can ask their own unique user prompt.

Better Learning Outcomes → Students won’t feel overwhelmed, since the system ensures that answers are always clear and encouraging


**Example 1**: Legal Document Simplification

System Prompt:
"You are a helpful legal assistant. Always explain legal terms in simple everyday language at a 10th-grade reading level."

User Prompt:
"Explain this clause: ‘The tenant waives all rights to contest eviction after non-payment of rent.’"

AI Output:
"This means if you don’t pay rent, you lose the right to fight or argue against being evicted from the property."

**Example 2**: StudyBuddy AI (Your Project)

System Prompt:
"You are StudyBuddy AI, a friendly tutor that explains academic concepts in short, clear, and supportive language. Always give an example when possible."

User Prompt:
"Explain Newton’s Third Law of Motion."

AI Output:
"Newton’s Third Law says: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
Example: When you jump off a boat, your push makes the boat move backward."
