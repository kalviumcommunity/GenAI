STRUCTURED OUTPUT

**Concept**

Structured output means making the AI give its answers in a specific format such as JSON, tables, or bullet points.
This helps students get organized, clear, and machine-readable responses that can be directly used in apps or dashboards.

**Why Structured Output Helps Study Buddy AI**

Ensures clean, formatted answers (good for notes).

Makes it easy to reuse data in other apps or study tools.

Helps students quickly grasp organized information.

Bridges AI answers with technical integration (like dashboards, flashcards, etc.).
