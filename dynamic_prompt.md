 What is Dynamic Prompting?
Dynamic prompting is the practice of automatically generating or adjusting prompts based on user input, context, or system state. Instead of using a fixed prompt, the AI system personalizes the prompt in real time.

- Personalize study outputs (quizzes, summaries, flashcards)
- Provide better, context-aware answers

**Generated Prompt (Biology):**

**Generated Prompt (N=3, Topic=Physics):** 
Create 3 quiz questions from the following Physics notes:
