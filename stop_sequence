**Concept**

A stop sequence is a special instruction that tells the AI where to stop generating text.
It acts like a "brake" — once the model outputs the stop sequence, it ends the response.

This is useful when we want controlled outputs, like short answers, structured JSON, or when avoiding extra text after an answer.

Why Stop Sequences Help Study Buddy AI

Ensures clean and controlled answers
Helps when teaching coding or JSON (avoids extra commentary)
Makes the bot feel more professional and exam-friendly
Useful in chatbots to avoid unintended role-switching

Example 1 – Quiz Answer

Prompt:

Question: Who is the President of the United States in 2025? 
Answer:


Stop sequence: "\n"

AI Response:

Joe Biden

 The AI stops immediately after the name, instead of adding extra context like “He was elected in …”.

 **Example 2 – JSON Output**

Prompt:

Give the following answer in JSON format:
{ "country": "India", "capital": "New Delhi" }


Stop sequence: "}"

AI Response:

{ "country": "India", "capital": "New Delhi" }


The AI stops right after the closing curly brace, preventing it from adding extra text like “Here is the JSON you requested.”

**Example 3 – Dialogue Control**

Prompt:

User: Tell me a joke
AI:


Stop sequence: "User:"

AI Response:

Why don’t skeletons fight? Because they don’t have the guts!


 The AI stops before it starts hallucinating another user turn.
